Improvements & Bugfixes List -- Because "Known Issues" Sounds Sad
==========================================================================

- Theta is reconstructed incompletely in current classdefs; needs corrections for +/- and 180 shift

- NeutronDataset is only halfway transitioned to new structure and therefore only partially functional
 
- capture-strip lookup for y pos. res. is currently very roundabout; should be pulled directly from .ibd.dat file
  
- position resolution: gaussian method currently simply places overshoots at the edge
  - also, flat method currently assumes uniform cell size (very minor issue)
