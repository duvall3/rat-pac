Improvements & Bugfixes List -- Because "Known Issues" Sounds Sad
==========================================================================

- Theta is reconstructed incompletely in current classdefs; needs corrections for +/- and 180 shift

- NeutronDataset is only halfway transitioned to new structure and therefore only partially functional
 
- capture-strip lookup for y pos. res. is currently very roundabout; should be pulled directly from .ibd.dat file
